# Bazel â€” Historical documentation

Welcome to the archived Bazel documentation! In February 2022, we migrated the documentation to create a better environment for the Bazel community to grow.

* See the [current docs](https://bazel.build).
* Read about the migration on our [blog](https://bit.ly/bazel-devsite-launch).
* Tell us [what you think](https://forms.gle/onkAkr2ZwBmcbWXj7k) about the migration.

Please update your bookmarks. We will continue to host the archived docs for now, but will turn them down at some point.

## Archived docs

Select your version from the left navigation dropdown menu in the Bazel [archived docs](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/5.0.0/bazel-overview.html).
