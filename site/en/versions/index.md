# Documentation Versions

The documentation on this website represents the latest in Bazel. Documentation
is updated at head. Each major supported release will have a snapshot of the
narrative and reference documentation that follows the lifecycle of Bazel's
version support.

For now, to see documentation for older Bazel versions, go to
[docs.bazel.build](https://docs.bazel.build/).
