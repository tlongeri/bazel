<code>List of <a href="${link build-ref#labels}">labels</a>
; optional</code>
</p>

<p>
A list of
<code><a href="platform.html#constraint_value">constraint_value</a></code>s
that must be present in the target platform for this target to be considered
<em>compatible</em>. This is in addition to any constraints already set by the
rule type. If the target platform does not satisfy all listed constraints then
the target is considered <em>incompatible</em>. Incompatible targets are
skipped for building and testing when the target pattern is expanded
(e.g. <code>//...</code>, <code>:all</code>). When explicitly specified on the
command line, incompatible targets cause Bazel to print an error and cause a
build or test failure.
</p>

<p>
Targets that transitively depend on incompatible targets are themselves
considered incompatible. They are also skipped for building and testing.
</p>

<p>
An empty list (which is the default) signifies that the target is compatible
with all platforms.
<p>

<p>
All rules other than <a href="workspace.html">Workspace Rules</a> support this
attribute.
For some rules this attribute has no effect. For example, specifying
<code>target_compatible_with</code> for a
<code><a href="c-cpp.html#cc_toolchain">cc_toolchain</a></code> is not useful.
<p>

<p>
See the
<a href="/docs/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets">Platforms</a>
page for more information about incompatible target skipping.
